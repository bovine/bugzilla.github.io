title: "4.4.13, 5.0.4, and 5.0.6 Security Advisory"
versions: ["5.0.6", "5.0.4", "4.4.13", "5.4", "6.0"]
date: 2024-08-29
fixed-in: 4.4.14, 5.0.4.1, 5.2, 5.3.3, and 5.9.1
bugs:
- summary: |-
    A malicious user could create an account on a third-party service
    such as GitHub which allows non-ASCII Unicode characters to be used
    in email addresses and use it to log into a Bugzilla account with
    lookalike ASCII characters in the email.
  class: Authentication Bypass
  affected: |-
    Versions 3.3.1 to 4.4.14, 4.5.1 to 5.0.4, 5.0.5 to 5.0.6,
    5.1.1 to 5.1.2, 5.3.2, git checkouts of "harmony" prior to
    5.9.1
  fixed-in: 4.4.14, 5.0.4.1, 5.2, 5.3.3, 5.9.1
  description: |-
    When using external authentication against a third party
    service (such as GitHub) which allows non-ASCII Unicode
    characters to be used in email addresses, Bugzilla's email
    address match would normalize the email into ASCII before
    comparing when using MySQL as a back end, enabling someone
    to take over a Bugzilla account if they created a user with
    an email address which would match that way on such a third
    party service.
    We are not aware of any known exploits for versions prior to
    the "harmony" developer branch which has not yet been
    released, as prior to that there were no known
    authentication plugins for third party authentication for
    Bugzilla. However, we are patching the earlier supported
    versions to prevent it anyway just in case someone had
    written their own plugin that might be affected.

- summary: |-
    Debugging code allowed XSS injection within the bug title
    when viewing charts and reports if a specific URL param was
    passed to enable the debugging code.
  class: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  affected: |-
    All versions before 4.4.14, 4.5.1 to 5.0.4, 5.0.5 to 5.0.6,
    5.1.1 to 5.1.2, 5.3.2, git checkouts of "harmony" prior to
    5.9.1
  fixed-in: 4.4.14, 5.0.4.1, 5.2, 5.3.3, 5.9.1
  description: |-
    Debugging code allowed XSS injection within the bug title
    when viewing charts and reports if a specific URL param was
    passed to enable the debugging code.
    Passing the debug flag now forces an HTML content type
    regardless of the requsted type, and properly filters the
    debug output.

  A Note About Upgrade Paths
  ==========================
  
  Bugzilla Versions within the 5.0.x range:
  * Versions 5.0.4 and older should upgrade to 5.0.4.1
  * Versions 5.0.5 and 5.0.6 should upgrade to 5.2 (which is equivalent to a
    point upgrade for you).
  
  Other versions of Bugzilla should upgrade to the newest version within
  the same branch.
