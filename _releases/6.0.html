<h2>Developer Preview Release 5.9.1</h2>

<p>Bugzilla 5.9.1 is a developer preview release of the code that will
eventually become Bugzilla 6.0. We currently do not recommend using this in a
production environment, but only for internal testing and seeing where Bugzilla
is going.</p>

<p>Upgrading to Bugzilla 5.9.1 from older versions of Bugzilla is currently
known to be broken. Attempting that upgrade on a backup non-production copy of
your Bugzilla site and reporting what's broken by filing a bug report would be
very helpful!</p>
