<h2>State of the 5.3 branch</h3>

<p>The 5.4 release has been abandoned. This used to be our primary development
branch, but development has moved to the new harmony branch (5.9.x), which is a
fusion of upstream Bugzilla with the code maintained by bugzilla.mozilla.org
which forked from Bugzilla 4.2 several years ago.<p>

<p>Development releases on this branch will be maintained until a clear upgrade
path from here to Harmony (5.9.x) is available.</p>
