## Bugzilla Support Options

The options described here are for installation, administration, and
customization support for Bugzilla server software. If you are an
end-user of a Bugzilla, please consult the support options made
available by that Bugzilla's owner.

## Where to Ask Questions

### By Email
  - **[Bugzilla Support Mailing List](https://lists.bugzilla.org/listinfo/support-list)** -
    This mailing list is for Bugzilla users and administrators of Bugzilla sites
    to ask for help or share information. You will need to subscribe to the list
    first before you can post to it, and you will need to remain subscribed until
    your question is answered if you want ot see the reply, since replies will
    also go to the list. You can unsubscribe easily once your question is
    answered if continuing to read the list isn't your thing.

### Chat Rooms
  - **[#bugzilla](https://web.libera.chat/#bugzilla)** on Libera.chat
  - **[#bugzilla:mozilla.org](https://matrix.to/#/#bugzilla:mozilla.org)**
    on Matrix
  - **[Bugzilla Discord](https://discord.gg/ZhN6uBA)**

Normally, all three of these are mirrored to each other, so you can chat on any
of them and people will see it on all three.  At the moment, the bridge is
broken so they can't see each other. You can still pick your favorite way to
access, and there are a few people who are watching all three of them.

If you come to the chat rooms to help, please stick around and wait for an
answer. We aren't ignoring you, but there are a lot of time zones on this
planet, and not everyone is awake or at their computer all the time. It's not
uncommon for a question to get answered 5 or 6 hours later when the person
answering gets out of bed in their home time zone.

We are no longer actively monitoring the #bugzilla channel on Freenode, as the
network management decided to ban the access method most of the Bugzilla
developers use to connect to it.

## Private Emails Do Not Help Others

If you mail one of the Bugzilla developers directly with a support question,
you're likely to be ignored. This doesn't mean that we don't want to help you out,
on the contrary, we very much want to see you succeed in using Bugzilla. Quite
simply, providing tech support takes the developers' time away from fixing bugs.
Most of them don't mind helping once in a while, but if everyone emails them,
well, you can see where that would go. There are other knowledgeable users and
administrators of Bugzilla, who are very familiar with it and enjoy spending time
helping people with it, and read and reply to the support mailing list. Some of the
developers help out there, too, when they have time. Thus we provide our general
support on the mailing list mentioned above, where lots of people have a chance to
answer your question (because you never know who knows the answer), and the
questions and answers get archived and can be used by future Bugzilla admins at
their leisure from a search engine. We'll also try to help you out on the IRC
or Matrix channels (see above) when possible.

## Commercial Support

Bugzilla is a community supported project. This means we don't directly
offer any commercial support, but rather provide the public forums
listed above where you can get assistance. If you're still looking for
commercial support for Bugzilla, however, you might try one of these
[consultants](consulting.html) who have offered their services.
