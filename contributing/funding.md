<h2>What Bugzilla Spends Money On</h2>

All monetary amounts listed on this page are in US Dollars (USD).

<h3>One Time Expenses</h3>

<p>Zarro Boogs Corporation was just recently formed by a group of the core
Bugzilla Developers in order to have a legal entity which could hold the
license to the Bugzilla trademark and potentially pay one or more developers.
We incured the following costs in setting up this entity:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>$1500.00</strong> - Legal fees related to researching the proper
structure for the new company, creating the founding documents to make the
company legit, and registering it with the State of Michigan</li>
<li><strong>$50.00</strong> - Filing fee to apply for ยง501(c)(4) status from
the US Internal Revenue Service</li>
<li><strong>$1700.00</strong> - Legal fees to cover lawyer time during
negotiations with the Mozilla Foundation to obtain the license to use the
Bugzilla trademark</li>
</ul>

<h4>Payoff Progress</h4>

<p>Funded by one-time donations.</p>

<h3>Ongoing Necessary Expenses</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>$53.00 per month</strong> - Server Hosting: 2 servers in Linode. Monthly.</li>
<li><strong>$25.00 per year</strong> - State of Michigan Non-profit filing fee.</li>
</ul>

<p>Funded by recurring donations.</p>
<p>As of 2023/09/07:</p>

<div class="fundprogress">
<span class="fundprogressbar_current">$5.00</span>
<progress class="fundprogressbar" max="5508" value="500">$5.00</progress>
<span class="fundprogressbar_total">$55.08</span>
</div>

<p>You can sign up to make a monthly contribution towards this goal in either of these places:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/bugzilla">GitHub Sponsors</a> (GitHub account required).</li>
    <li><a href="https://liberapay.com/bugzilla/">Liberapay</a> any payment type Stripe will accept (credit, debit, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ongoing "Nice to have" expenses</h3>

<p>Any money received beyond the goals in the above two categories will go into
a pool to be used towards hiring a developer to work on code or review submitted
patches. Once enough money collects to be worth funding a project, we'll have
someone work on it.</p>

<p>Our pie-in-the-sky goal right now is to have a permanent part-time developer
to work around 20 hours per per week on Bugzilla on whatever needs doing, and
not just one-off projects. To do this, we anticipate needing about $4000 per
month.</p>

<p>This progress meter will not start filling until one of the above fills up.</p>

<div class="fundprogress">
<span class="fundprogressbar_current">$0</span>
<progress class="fundprogressbar" max="4000" value="0">$0</progress>
<span class="fundprogressbar_total">$4000</span>

<h2>Why Bugzilla Needs Money Now</h2>

<p>Historically, most of Bugzilla's development was done by coders who worked
at companies who used Bugzilla, where those companies allowed them to spend
time working on the public version of Bugzilla since it got their features
included in future Bugzilla versions without them having to locally customize
it.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is no longer the case. In the name of immediate productivity,
companies get the quickest results by customizing their local copy only for
their own use, and not taking the time to contribute those changes to the
public version.  Being able to upgrade it down the line without losing their
customizations is "someone else's problem in the future." (Indidentally, we'd
love your help if you're a company that uses Bugzilla and can let one of your
internal developers spend a couple hours per week on Bugzilla!)</p>

<p>Because Bugzilla is now in this position, we are trying to raise enough
money to directly pay at least one developer, so that it will actually be
someone's job to work on Bugzilla, at least part time. That is our
pie-in-the-sky goal.</p>

<h2>The Legal Stuff</h2>

<p>In mid-2023, a group of the core developers formed Zarro Boogs Corporation
(ZBC) in order to be a legal entity which could hold the license to the
Bugzilla Trademark and raise money on behalf of the project. ZBC is a
non-charitable non-profit organization (US Tax Code ยง501(c)(4) status pending
IRS approval), and registered as a Non-Profit Corporation in the State of
Michigan, which means we are required to spend all money raised on the needs of
the project, and not make a profit on it. However, since we are not a charity,
your donations will not be tax deductible.</p>
